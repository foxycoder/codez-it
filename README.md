# Codez.it

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/foxycoder/codez-it.png)](http://travis-ci.org/foxycoder/codez-it)

A hosted highly customisable blogging platform for developers. Including all the necessary stuff coders need when they blog.

When we're done, you will be able to create your own blog at `<yourname>.codez.it`. 

How cool is that?
